# Hi, I'm Jordan Gilfillan 👋

I'm a **software engineer**, **AI researcher**, and **entrepreneur** building the future of **Personality Models** at [Linear AI](https://linearai.me). With a passion for **augmented intelligence**, I explore how AI can enhance human expression, creativity, and decision-making rather than replace it.

## 🔥 What I'm Working On

- **[Linear AI](https://linearai.me)** – A platform for deeply personalized AI models that adapt, evolve, and interact meaningfully.
- **Open-Source AI Research** – Exploring ways to fine-tune AI to better capture human personality and interaction patterns.
- **Human-AI Synergy** – Designing AI-driven workflows that complement human thinking, not override it.

## ⚡ Skills & Interests

- 🧠 **AI & ML** – Fine-tuning, embeddings, and natural language processing.
- 🏗️ **Full-Stack Development** – Python, Node.js, and cloud architecture.
- 🎸 **Creative Tech** – Music AI, generative art, and experimental interfaces.
- 🌲 **Off-Grid Living** – Building my own off-grid house in Siskiyou County.

## 🌍 My Philosophy

I believe in **empowering people through AI**, making technology work for humans instead of the other way around. I focus on **open, ethical AI** that fosters creativity, collaboration, and deeper self-awareness.
